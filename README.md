Our project is a movie database that involves two tables:
  1. Film
  2. Director

A director can be involved with many films, but a film can only be associated with one director (One-to-many relationship).

The columns for the Film table will be:
  1. FilmID, Name, Year, Director, and Description


  FilmID # | Name |Year | Director | Description

Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.

# group-project
Our project is a movie database that involves two tables:
  1. Film
  2. Director

A director can be involved with many films, but a film can only be associated with one director (One-to-many relationship).

The columns for the Film table will be:
  1. FilmID, Name, Year, Director, and Description

The columns for the Director table will be:
  1. ID, Name, Ageï¼ŒGender
